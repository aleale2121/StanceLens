## Introduction

In the era of social media, understanding user interactions is crucial. StanceLens leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user-generated content, detecting stances to facilitate better content moderation and community management. Understanding user interactions is crucial in

## Features

- **Stance Detection**: Identifies whether a user agrees, disagrees, or is neutral about a topic.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes data in real time to provide immediate insights.
- **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of data efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

To install StanceLens, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleale2121/StanceLens-Detection-and-Response-System.git
   cd StanceLens-Detection-and-Response-System
Here's the corrected `README.md` without displaying unformatted text after step 2:

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the system using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Please look at the [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Dataset

StanceLens utilizes a dataset of user interactions from various social media platforms.

The dataset includes labeled instances of agreement, disagreement, and neutrality.

For more information on the dataset and how to obtain it, see [Dataset Details](docs/dataset.md).

## Model Architecture

The system employs a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to detect stances. Detects stances by combining with

The architecture includes components for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.

Detailed information can be found in the [Model Architecture](docs/model_architecture.md) document.

## Training

To train the model on your data:

1. **Prepare your dataset** following the format specified in [Dataset Preparation](docs/dataset_preparation.md).

2. **Run the training script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/data
   ```

Training parameters and options are described in the [Training Guide](docs/training_guide.md).

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --test_data /path/to/test/data
```

Evaluation metrics and interpretation are detailed in the [Evaluation Guide](docs/evaluation_guide.md).
